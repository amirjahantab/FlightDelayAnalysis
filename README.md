# Flight Delay Data Processing & Analysis

This repository contains a data processing and analysis project focused on flight delay datasets. The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze flight data using machine learning techniques for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project involves:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Handling missing values in flight numbers  
  - Splitting and formatting location data  
  - Standardizing airline names  
  - Expanding delay data into separate columns  

- **Statistical Analysis & Data Visualization**  
  - Computing summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)  
  - Generating correlation matrices and visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)  

- **Feature Extraction & Dimensionality Reduction**  
  - Extracting new delay-related features  
  - Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction
